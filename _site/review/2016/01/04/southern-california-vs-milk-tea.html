						<h2>Southern California vs Milk Tea (part 1)</h2>

						<span class="content-text"><p><p>As a milk tea connoisseur, the subject of milk tea comes up often in my day to day conversation with others. One of the more opinionated discussion is whether or not <strong>SoCal milk tea is <em>so</em> much better than NorCal milk tea.</strong> I hear this quite often, actually – from those who visited SoCal to those who lived in SoCal. So yeah, needless to say as someone who is addicted to milk tea, I wanted to see if thi seemingly universal opinion was true.</p>

<p>So four friends and I rented out a car, and planned a five day trip down to Souther Califorina (with only 3 actual day of being there).</p>

<center><img src="/assets/media/souther_california_vs_milk_tea/socalBoba.png" width="70%" /></center>

<p>I apologize for the low quality of the photo. Unfortunately for us, the camera we brought with us broke at the start of our trip and we had to resort to my cell phone as a way to document our adventure in Southern California.</p>

<p>As you can clearly see in the photograph, we came to Southern California, and explored as many milk tea shops as possible. And after having tasted six different milk tea shops, some more than once, I feel confident enough to make a comparison between NorCal milk tea versus SoCal milk tea.</p>

<p>But first, let’s see how all of the milk tea shops I went to stand. <em>I also received inputs from my friends for this review, so a special thank you to all of those in the photo!</em></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Here is the list of the milk tea shops we’ve visited:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.halfandhalfteaexpress.com/">Half &amp; Half</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.bobabear.com/">Boba Bear</a></li>

</ol>

<p>Wow… that’s a lot of milk tea shops for 3 days. I may or may not need to write a part two for this review because that’s literally <em>six</em> different milk tea shops I have to review. And, of course, I have to decide whether or not Southern California really has the best milk tea.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="half--half">1. Half &amp; Half</h3>
<p>This is the first milk tea shop we went to as soon as we reached Southern California. This place was highly recommended by both my friend’s sister, and by my peers. Right after we unpacked our car, we made way to Ranch 99 and Half &amp; Half.</p>

<p>By the time we reached Half &amp; Half, the line was out the back door. We had pretty high expectations at this point – I mean if the line started from the front of the shop and goes all the way out to the back of the shop, it has to be good right??</p>

<p>So we ended up ordering <strong>eight</strong> milk teas. And to be dead honest, I don’t even remember what we all ordered, just the ones that really stood out to me.</p>

<p>But here is a general overall review:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Overall: ★★★★★</p>

    <p>This place was <strong>great</strong>. I got the <strong>Jasmine Milk Tea</strong> three times. If you know what you like, then you will most definitely enjoy your drink. I went here on two different occasions, in two different locations. <strong>Both locations have the same consistency</strong>, which is awesome! The milk tea was good, and the boba was the perfect texture, flavor, and chewiness. It was definitely worth the wait. <em>Tip: order over the phone if you don’t have the time, and a lot of people are with you! ($10+ orders only).</em></p>

    <p>However some of their drinks are very particular, such as the <strong>Taro Milk Tea</strong> and <strong>Coffee Milk Tea</strong>. I can see how the Taro Milk Tea can be good, because it had actual taro pieces inside the drink, but that was just not for me. In addition to this, I felt like both the Taro Milk Tea and Coffee Milk Tea were <strong>too sweet</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Milk Tea: ★★★★☆</p>

    <p>My <strong>Jasmine Fresh Milk Tea</strong> was perfect. It was perfect in consistency, in how much milk was in the drink, and how sweet it was. It had the taste that was exactly at the perfect point where it tasted good – and anymore milk would have made it watery, and anymore sugar would have made it sugar water. So it was quite impressive as to how they made this specific milk tea so perfect.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, I also bought a <strong>Coffee Milk Tea</strong> (as a wild card) at my first time there, and saved it for the next day. My first sip made me cringe – my impression of it was simply just <strong>sugary milk with a taste of coffee</strong>. It’s coffee milk tea, I am expecting it to be a bit more bitter! Instead, it was even sweeter than my jasmine milk tea and my friend’s brown sugar milk tea! I literally threw away the drink before a quarter of it was drank. It felt too slimy, and sweet for my taste. Needless to say, I was super disappointed on my second drink at Half &amp; Half. But I also recognize that coffee is an off choice in flavor, so I should not hold it against Half &amp; Half too much. Mostly since all of the Jasmine Fresh Milk Tea that I have ordered were good – and I ordered like three of them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Boba: ★★★★★</p>

    <p>I’m super impress with the boba here. I really don’t know what else to say about it. It wasn’t too sweet (both times that I went), so it didn’t over power the tea itself or sweetened the tea more. But the boba was sweet enough so that when you are chewing on it, you taste the honey.</p>

    <p>In addition to this, the boba itself is not too hard or too soft, which is a huge plus because this is the hardest part in making boba good. The texture can completely ruin the drink because I’d spend days dodging the boba itself because I didn’t want to chew it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistency: ★★★★★</p>

    <p>This is what gets me to come back to the shop over and over again. I went to this chain in two different locations, and have ordered similar drinks both times. The taste stays the same, even if I put in the fridge for the night. The biggest difference was probably the fact that by leaving it in the fridge, the drink was a bit more watery – which is totally my fault. But it was good nonetheless!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pricing: ★★★★★</p>

    <p>It’s pretty cheap – I think we bought about five drinks for around $13 dollars? For how good it tastes, it is totally worth the ~$3.25 a cup. The price is pretty normal, many milk tea shops charge around this amount for a cup of milk tea. So it is not much to complain about!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So if you’re going to Southern California, and you’re craving milk tea. I would recommend you stopping by Half &amp; Half. <strong>It is hands down the best milk tea shop that I tried in Southern California.</strong> I’m not sure if I can find an equivalent one in Northern California, to be honest.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="boba-bear">2. Boba Bear</h3>

<p>No. Nope. No. Just no. Please no. Oh god no. An exaggeration? <em>Not really…</em> My friends and I came to an agreement that this place <strong>sucks</strong>. Like I can’t even come up with any excuses for it. <strong>Straight up just tastes like a slightly better Jasmine Milk Tea from Quickly’s.</strong> There would actually be no reason why I would <em>ever</em> come here again. I mean, unless I wanted to get high.</p>

<p>In the beginning, I thought it seemed neat (or the idea, at least) because it is a milk tea shop that has a hookah lounge with games for you to entertain yourself. OK, so the idea is pretty unique and interesting, I can see why this could be a place people go to before trying out their milk teas. <strong>However everyone who ordered a drink, except for one person, threw their drinks away (including me) because the drinks were terrible.</strong></p>

<p>Here is my broken down review:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Overall: ★☆☆☆☆</p>

    <p>Did I mention how my <strong>Jasmine Milk Tea</strong> tasted like a slightly, <em>just slightly</em>, better milk tea than Quickly’s? We ordered four Jasmine Milk Tea, and one regular milk tea. So it wasn’t just a fluke for my cup – all of our cups tasted the same, and was just as bad.</p>

    <p>My first impression when I sipped it was the fact that the drink was <strong>thick and slimy</strong>. OK… this is definitely not how I like my drinks to taste. It was a very heavy drink, almost as if they used whatever kind of creamer <a href="http://www.philzcoffee.com/">Philz Coffee</a> uses for their Iced Mint Mojito Coffee (known to be 120% fat or something like that). And when it finally reached the back of my throat, it just stuck there.</p>

    <p>The only thing they have going for them is the setting they created. The fact that it is unique in the sense that it has a hookah lounge, and a board game room for people to entertain themselves. Oh, and I guess having wifi is a plus. So really the only good thing here, in my opinion, is the fact that you can actually sit down and socialize/hang out with your friends.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Milk Tea: ☆☆☆☆☆</p>

    <p>No. I wouldn’t even drink it if someone bought the drink for me. Seriously, it is 0 stars for me. The Jasmine Milk Tea just felt so fattening to the point that I could not even finish more than a quarter of it. I ended up throwing it away.</p>

    <p>Not only is the texture of the drink heavy, and slimy, it is also <em>way</em> too sweet for me. If you have had a Quickly’s Jasmine milk tea before, just imagine the the sweetness level being a little bit higher, and the texture of the drink to be a bit more buttery and less powdery.</p>

    <p><strong>It didn’t even taste like tea</strong>, in any aspect! So they lost the biggest selling point for me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Boba: ★★★☆☆</p>

    <p>I haven’t mentioned anything about the boba so far in the review – and this is simply because it was just “eh”. It wasn’t anything special, as it did not stand out for being perfect and good. But at the same time, the boba was not terrible.</p>

    <p>Sadly, this is the shop’s only plus. And I do not like the actual tapioca balls enough to come here for it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistency: ★★★★★</p>

    <p>Like I mentioned above, four out of five of us got a Jasmine Milk Tea. And we all tried each other’s drink. And it all tasted the same – which is good if you like the drinks here. It seems that regardless of how many orders were placed, they were able to recreate the drink without any problems.</p>

    <p>So if you like the drinks here, well you’re in luck because they’re pretty consistent and will probably not disappoint you. Though a slight disclaimer is that we only went to this shop once, it just so happens four of us got the same drink. I don’t really know how they hold up in day to day comparison.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pricing: ★☆☆☆☆</p>

    <p>It was like a $4.50 dollar for a regular sized cup with boba. <strong>What the f***?!</strong> I’m not going to lie… I was expecting the drink to be pretty good because of how much they charge their drinks. And no, it did not include the price of using the hookah lounge (you have to pay for that separately).</p>

    <p>Jesus… talk about a cut throat price for how bad their milk tea is. Many places I have been to, if a cup of milk tea is over $4, it’s usually because I upgraded to a bigger size (~24 oz) or it is organic/artisan/all-natural. But no. None of this at Boba Bear. Just the pure fact that it has a hookah lounge.</p>

    <p>Honestly, I could have gone to Quickly’s and grabbed a drink there and would have been less disappointed. At least at Quickly’s, they wouldn’t have tried to over charge me for a very disappointing cup of milk tea.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So yeah… <strong>I do not recommend you coming here.</strong> There are plenty of other milk tea stores you can go to and play board games at. This place is only “worth” if you want to use their hookah lounge, I guess.</p>

<p>After talking about my experience here with one of my friends, she suggested that the reason why the milk tea sucked so much may have been because I didn’t get high. So who knows, if any of y’all happens visit Boba Bear and use their hookah lounge while drinking their milk tea – let me know if it tastes better than what I wrote.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="ozero-tea--desserts">3. Ozero Tea &amp; Desserts</h3>

<p>OK… I messed this one up pretty bad. The drink I usually do my reviews on is with the Jasmine Milk Tea, however in the process of buying five different drinks, I accidentally drank mainly the Brown Sugar Milk Tea. And the Brown Sugar Milk Tea definitely gave me a worse impression initally simply because it does not taste like what I was expecting.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Overall: ★★★★☆</p>

    <p>I ordered a Jasmine Milk Tea, as always. However the drink that I drank for the most part was a Brown Sugar Milk Tea – not really my cup of tea. It wasn’t until halfway through the drink did I realize I had been drinking the wrong cup. So needless to say, I was thoroughly disappointed up until that point because the drink did not taste like anything I had ordered (as expected).</p>

    <p>Unfortunately I did not get the experience of ordering and visiting the shop itself because we were in a rush, and just had one person pick up all the drinks. I would say the only downside for this milk tea shop was the fact that the location seemed very sketchy, and a bit out of the way for us personally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Milk Tea: ★★★★☆</p>

    <p>The milk tea was good however it did not stand out to me at all. I like it, and I would go there if I was invited to hangout there but it is not a shop I would religiously go to. The drink had a creamy texture, which fills me up – probably because of milk they use. I’m not a huge big fan of a creamy texture because it gets stuck in the back of my throat but luckily this drink’s creamy texture is just right.</p>

    <p>The biggest downfall for me here is how sweet the drink is, mostly if you combine it with their boba. This is a personal preference.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Boba: ★★★★★</p>

    <p>I really don’t have an opinion on this boba. Like I mentioned above, the boba is <em>actually</em> honey boba – meaning it is actually sweet. At the same time, the boba was not hard or too soft. My only complaint here is that they give too much boba as someone who does not like a lot of boba in their drinks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistency: N/A</p>

    <p>Unfortunately for this shop, we all got a different drink and it was not exactly good enough for us to make a second trip out of the way to get it. I do not have an idea of how consistant the drink is.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pricing: ★★★☆☆</p>

    <p>I mean, if you average it out, it isn’t super expensive. However it is only if you enjoy more complicated drinks. However <strong>$4</strong> for a regular Jasmine Milk Tea. I mean, all of their drinks are the same price so I can’t really complain too much. It’s just sad when you prefer a much simplier drink that <em>shouldn’t</em> take too much work to make.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Overall it was a good experience that did not stand out to me. Actually, I think I got this drink when I was super tired so I did not remember much about the drink. But if you’re looking for milk tea around the neighborhood, I wouldn’t dismiss this little shop!</p>

<p>As you can tell, this review is significantly shorter than the other ones, and I hope that speaks for something. I still have three more milk tea shops to review from SoCal before I let you know my final verdict about whether or not SoCal milk tea is <em>really</em> better than NorCal!</p>
