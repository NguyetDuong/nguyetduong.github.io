        <title>Goodbye 2015, Hello 2016!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy New Years!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year had really been more stressful than I could have ever imagined. I had a lot of ups and downs. I was lost more than a million times on what to do, and where to go. But I suppose that was because I was never really focused on what I am trying to get out of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to change that this year. I need a set of reminders on how I want this new year to be different from the last. This new year should be more of an improvement from the last because I am sick of how it’s been, and I realized that nothing is ever going to change unless I fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is probably my first year in a long time that I have a new year’s goals. I came up with some of these after talking with someone about what I had in mind for the new year. It made me realize that I never really had a guided direction into anything, and maybe having some goals will push me into the right direction this year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we go…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Keep up with my blog.&lt;/strong&gt;
I seriously created this website for a blog, and I have not written a single thing since September. I feel like I am just so caught up in my life with all of its technical aspects that I don’t focus on my creativity side anymore. For all of those who don’t know – I used to blog &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; back in high school. So hopefully I can get at least a post a month or even maybe do a challenge to blog every day for 30 days straight!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Cut down on all that milk tea.&lt;/strong&gt; 
Let’s be honest, it really is not that healthy to drink a cup a day. Maybe twice or three times a week would be more reasonable. It’s becoming a really unhealthy habit in my life that I need to cut out. The sugar addiction really is not helping me with anything at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Keep a personal journal, and write in it everyday.&lt;/strong&gt;
I really enjoyed writing in the past, as I’ve mentioned before about my daily blog posts in high school. Unfortunately every year since the start of college, I made up excuses to not write in it because I was &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; busy. This semester will be my lightest semester, so I should be able to keep this goal, even if it’s only 200 words a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Be more social!&lt;/strong&gt;
What I’ve noticed over the past few years in college is that I have became less and less social. As in I no longer go out of my way to talk to strangers anymore because I’ve became a lot more shy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems a lot for my goals this year, and I don’t expect myself to accomplish every single one gracefully. However I hope that by December 31, 2016, I can say that I have accomplished at least one of these goals. Wish me luck, and let me know what goal(s) you have for the new year!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shengkee, the Source of My Addiction</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people who know me now know that I have an addiction to milk tea. My addiciton might just be worse than those who requires a cup of coffee in the morning to start working. They know this fact because I have gotten a peak of five cups a day within the past year, and a low of one. Though if I am honest with myself, ever since the semester has started, I’ve averaged around two cups a day. While this amount is about how much a regular coffee addict drinks, the cost is insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/addictions/bobacups.jpg&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t always like this… I actually rarely ever got milk tea when I was in high school. I didn’t even have my first sip of milk tea until my &lt;em&gt;sophomore year of high school&lt;/em&gt; while majority of my peers are already familiar with the taste of the drink and the texture of the tapioca balls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In high school, milk tea was a rare occasion. This is mostly because there weren’t many milk tea shops around the area where I lived and went to school. If my friends and I wanted to get milk tea, we would have to travel for about fifteen to twenty minutes by foot, up and down San Francisco’s hills – and all of this trouble for milk tea that I now consider to be “low tier.” If we wanted better drinks, the travel time would have been forty five to an hour by bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So obviously, milk tea was out of the picture for most of our after school activities. Instead, we opt to “study” for our classes and “work” on our homework at a nearby coffee shop called &lt;a href=&quot;http://mamasf.com/&quot;&gt;Mama’s Art Café&lt;/a&gt; instead. And that was where I spent most of my time and money in high school. Not on milk tea but on an ice Chai Latte (often with whip cream on top), with a vegetarian bagel on the side. I was a hipster before hipster was a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then all good things have to come to an end, and I graduated from high school. That means I have to find another place to fulfill the emptiness in my day once I arrived to UC Berkeley. Which, by the way, was actually the summer before my freshman year because I had to take mandatory summer classes. Like actually mandatory because those who accepted me wanted to make sure I didn’t totally fail out of UC Berkeley. So here’s the solution they gave me: take summer school classes, and if I failed, I can’t attend UC Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh OK. Pretty much I risked going to college (in general) for UC Berkeley because I wouldn’t have SIR’d to other schools. All is good though – I ended up passing with flying colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is where the addiction started….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;berkeleys-summer-is-blazing-hot&quot;&gt;Berkeley’s summer is blazing hot.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s actually a lot hotter than I anticipated it to be. So to cool down, here are the options I am given: Peet’s Coffee, Starbucks, ShengKee Bakery’s milk tea, and a smoothie at the Golden Bear Café. While every single option is great, a smoothie is too cold and icy for me, along with a frappuccino and javiva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in all honesty, all of the previously mentioned options are too sweet for me and ended up crashing me more than it helped me stay awake – which was something I desperately needed over the summer. I mean, after all, I needed to pass all of these classes. So I begin my search for the perfect drink to keep me alive while I type out paragraphs after paragraphs of analysis on Chicano Studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the first week, my friend (let’s call him Ryan) and I decided to go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shengkee.com/en/index.aspx&quot;&gt;ShengKee Bakery&lt;/a&gt; because Ryan was persistent on buying some Asian pastries. So yeah, we did not initially start going there for the milk tea but rather for pastries that reminded us of home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while we were at it, we spied the menu which sold a &lt;strong&gt;chubby&lt;/strong&gt; cup of milk tea for $2.99 – and toppings are free!! For two cheap, Asian, and college students, this was a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; deal. As a result, Ryan and I picked our drinks. Tiger Milk Tea with boba for Ryan, and Jasmine Milk Tea with boba for me. I had the Jasmine Milk Tea specially made because at the time, they did not have it. Instead they had Jasmine Tea, and ended up mixing it with the regular half and half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first sip was &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t think I can describe you how all of my senses felt when I took the first sip of the iced cold tea mixed with half and half, boba balls, and sugar. I chugged the first cup I got. I don’t think (up to that point) that I have ever tasted soft and chewy boba balls, and a Jasmine Milk Tea that was in such a perfect consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan and I enjoyed our diabetes sized drink as we walked back to our dorm to continue our readings on Chicano Studies. And for once, I did not feel the need to take a quick nap to keep myself awake – the milk tea had enough caffeine to keep me cracked out to go through over 50 pages text!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we just ended up buying a cup whenever we felt as though our energy was low. The trip down to Shengkee and back up to our dorm served initially as a break. A break with a sweet taste. Of course we both didn’t know how big of a problem this will spiral into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the third week of the program, two week after we discovered this amazing crack called ShengKee Bakery’s milk tea, we were known as the regulars there by an amazing cashier named Marie. Every time we walked into the store while she’s working, she already knew what we were going to buy. A Tiger Milk Tea with boba for Ryan, and a Jasmine Milk Tea with boba for me! Marie often teases us about our consistency and our loyalty to ShengKee Bakery. And of course, she made a comment about how we were addicted to our drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t admit to it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the deal the turned what seemed to be a harmless routine into an addiction I can’t escape:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;buy-2-chubby-cups-for-499&quot;&gt;Buy 2 Chubby Cups for $4.99&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Oh god, I can’t even tell you how excited Ryan and I were when we saw this deal. Now if one of us wanted milk tea, &lt;em&gt;both of us has to get it&lt;/em&gt;. Essentially we were each other’s enablers. At this point, because the deal was provoking us, pressuring us to make a good use out of it, we kept buying the drinks to get the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, for weeks and weeks, we repeatedly run to Shengkee in the afternoon (as they don’t serve milk tea until 10am – by then we were already in classes until the afternoon) to buy our daily cup of milk tea. This deal lasted through the entire summer. Honestly, we thought we would have gotten sick of milk tea after a week or so of daily intake. This wasn’t the case… instead, as midterm (and essay writing) season rolled around, we started staying up until 3am or 4am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess what we used instead of coffee to stay awake? &lt;em&gt;Milk tea.&lt;/em&gt; As a reward for ourselves, and a source of caffeine to keep ourselves awake, before Shengkee Bakery closed (11pm on weekdays, and 12am on weekends), we ran to purchase our drinks. Before we know it, we got two milk teas a day. These cups were 25oz each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drinking milk tea became a very consistent part of my life. I needed it – I spent too much time with it and I can no longer escape from it. By training myself to become more effective with the addictive drink by my side, I can’t focus and work without it. It becomes a need to be productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks, Ryan, you are an enabler who got me addicted to milk tea. And you’re welcome for the addiction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you &lt;a href=&quot;flickr.com/photos/cathleenjia/&quot;&gt;Cathleen Jia&lt;/a&gt; for providing the photo!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This Blog &amp; Me</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html&quot;&gt;dark playground&lt;/a&gt;! I will be spending my “&lt;em&gt;spare&lt;/em&gt;” time writing up posts that appear relevant to me and my life in the moment. Notice how I put spare in quotes – meaning that I will probably be writing these posts when I shouldn’t be. Oops. At least I can admit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry, I’m a &lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt; (notice the sarcasm). I have had a long history in relation to blogs, which I will talk about later on in this post. But for now, I want to warn you about my blogging habits: my goal is to post &lt;strong&gt;an average of twice a month&lt;/strong&gt;. You may see an influx of posts in the beginning of the school year, and see me die down as the academic semester because I will be swamped with work and procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize in advance, this will be one of my longer posts :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/this_blog_and_me/img.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure if you are reading this post, you are curious as to my goals, intentions, and topic for this blog. Unless I never update my blog and this remains as my only post. (I really hope that doesn’t happen.) So to make it easier on you, I broke down this topic into sections so it can be easily navigated. This post is primarily about my blog, and less about me. &lt;a href=&quot;/about/&quot;&gt;Click here if you want to read more about me!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-blogging-history&quot;&gt;My Blogging History&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not my first time blogging – maybe my first time blogging “professionally” (whatever that means) – but in the past, I have kept a personal blog where I would post &lt;em&gt;religiously&lt;/em&gt;. I’m talking about an average of &lt;strong&gt;1.25 posts a day&lt;/strong&gt;, focusing on daily reflections. However this only lasted for about a year (my Freshman and beginning of Sophomore year of high school). I stopped completely by the end of my Junior year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owning a blog and a website have been my goal for quite a long time. “A long time” is an understatement. I wanted to have my own blog and site way before 2009 (I have concrete proof in 2009 through my ridiculous Facebook post). But six/seven years later, I am able to fulfill my goal in having my own website with a blog hosted on it. I’m quite proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-goals-for-my-blog&quot;&gt;My Goals for My Blog&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want this blog to hold some resemblance to the blogs I’ve always wanted to have when I was younger. Including having some similarities to my personal blog I had back in high school. This means that at the end of my journey (hopefully never!), I want this blog to be &lt;strong&gt;a form of reflection&lt;/strong&gt; for myself (and maybe others) in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I want to have fun with my blog. This blog is meant to be a part of who I am and what are important to my life at the moment, as I have mentioned before. Which brings me to talk about the next topic….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-direction-in-blogging&quot;&gt;My Direction in Blogging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I write something on this blog, I want it to document a part of my life. So as I have mentioned in the beginning, the posts in this blog will be relevant to events and situations that are happening to me in real life, around the time I post up my posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it just so happen, as you will read, I am currently battling an addiction to milk tea. It is a huge part of my life – I probably averaged a cup a day since the summer before my freshman year of college (Summer 2013) up until the beginning of this summer (Summer 2015). That’s a solid &lt;em&gt;two years&lt;/em&gt;. So definitely expect a lot of posts about milk tea and my expertise on this subject!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though being addicted to milk tea &lt;em&gt;isn’t the only thing&lt;/em&gt; I have going on in my life. I am currently trying to figure out my goals in college and in life. So by writing about them and my attempts to achieve these goals, I will have a reminder of the success and challenges I’ve faced. And in my perspective, these will remind me of my motivation when I fall. And hopefully, people (specifically incoming college freshmen and high school students – more on this later) will be able to use my experiences as a guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And honestly, I love to talk so this is for my friends who are just &lt;em&gt;sooooooo sick&lt;/em&gt; of me opening my mouth. Just kidding, I love every single one of them. They are the reasons I am the person who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-target-audience-single&quot;&gt;My Target Audience (SINGLE)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her name is Isabella Marie Swan. She is a senior in high school, and an incoming Freshman in Dartmouth. At the moment, she is blind to what her life will when she leaves Forks, Washington for college. And to be honest, she has a bit of an addiction or obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a hobby, she spends a lot of time reading. Isabella tends to keep to herself at most times but enjoys looking up materials she wishes to know more about. I guess you can call her &lt;em&gt;Curious &lt;strike&gt;George&lt;/strike&gt; Isabella&lt;/em&gt;. It has actually have gotten her into a lot of trouble in the past, including breaking her heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Props to you if you understood this reference. If you didn’t, I’ll credit it at the end of this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pretty much copied this out of my notebook. Not word for word but you get the point. This is me using what I’ve learned this summer to create content with someone specific in mind. And in doing so, hopefully I can make my content more focused. Though I wouldn’t be surprise if my friends (who honestly don’t fit the target audience description whatsoever) read my posts and then bring it up to me in person to watch me cringe at my own writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to write and I want to inspire. And if you happened to think this post was way too long for you to endure. Here is my response: same. So here is my tl;dr (too long; didn’t read) summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This blog is a reflection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I will be talking about whatever is happening in my life. So at the moment, these things are: milk tea, and college career choices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want high schoolers and incoming college students to read my blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in case you are seriously wondering the reference, the reference is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_(series)&quot;&gt;Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically the main character in her point of view during &lt;em&gt;New Moon&lt;/em&gt;. But this doesn’t mean, my possible audience is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; Bella. It’s supposed to be a joke – no insults, I swear. But I hope you can see the key characteristics I’m trying to go off of and ignore the silly ones!&lt;/p&gt;
