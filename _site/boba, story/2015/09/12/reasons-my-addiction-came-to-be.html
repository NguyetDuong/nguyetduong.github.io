						<h2>Reasons My Addiction Came to Be</h2>
						
						<p class="content-date">12 September 2015 • <a href="/tags/milktea," title="View posts tagged with &quot;milktea,&quot;">milktea,</a>  <a href="/tags/story" title="View posts tagged with &quot;story&quot;">story</a> </p>
						

						<span class="content-text"><p><p>Many people who know me now know that I have an addiction to milk tea. My addiciton might just be worse than those who requires a cup of joe in the morning to start working. The reason for this is simply because I have gotten a peak of five cups a day within the past year, and a low of one. Though if I am honest with myself, every since the semester has started, I’ve averaged around two cups a day. While this amount is about how much a regular coffee addict drinks, the cost is insane.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/media/addictions/bobacups.jpg" width="70%" style="padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom:30px" /></center>

<p>But it wasn’t always like this… I actually rarely ever got milk tea when I was in high school. I didn’t even have my first sip of milk tea until my <em>sophomore year of high school</em> while majority of my peers are already familiar with the taste of the drink and the texture of the tapioca balls.</p>

<p>In high school, milk tea was a rare occassion. This is mostly because there weren’t many milk tea shops around the area where I lived and went to school. If my friends and I wanted to get milk tea, we would have to travel for about fifteen to twenty minutes by foot, up and down San Francisco’s hills – and all of this trouble for milk tea that I now consider to be “low tier.” If we wanted better drinks, the travel time would have been fourty-five to an hour by bus.</p>

<p>So obviously, milk tea was out of the picture for most of our after school activities. Instead, we opt to “study” for our classes and “work” on our homework at a nearby café shop instead. And that was where I spent most of my time and money in high school. Not on milk tea but on an ice Chai Latte, with a vegetarian bagel on the side. I was a hipster before hipster was a thing.</p>

<p>But then all good things have to come to an end, and I graduated from high school. That means I have to find another place to fulfill the emptiness in my day once I arrived to UC Berkeley. Which, by the way, was actually the summer before my freshman year because I had to take mandatory summer class. Like actually mandatory because those who accepted me wanted to make sure I didn’t crash and burn in the school. So here’s the solution they gave me: take summer school classes, and if I failed, I can’t attend UC Berkeley.</p>

<p>Uh OK. Pretty much I risked going to college (in general) for UC Berkeley because I wouldn’t have SIR’d to other schools. All is good though – I ended up passing with flying colors.</p>

<p>And this is where the addiction started….</p>

<h3 id="berkeleys-summer-is-blazing-hot">Berkeley’s summer is blazing hot.</h3>

<p>It’s actually a lot hotter than I anticipated it to be. So to cool down, here are the options I am given: Peet’s Coffee, Starbucks, ShengKee Bakery’s milk tea, and a smoothie at the Golden Bear Café. While every single option is great, a smoothie is too cold and icy for me, along with a frappuccino and javiva.</p>

<p>And in all honesty, all of the previous options are too sweet and ended up crashing me more than it helped me stay awake – which was something I desperately needed over the summer. I mean, after all, I needed to pass all of these classes in order to be officially admitted into Berkeley. So I begin my search for the perfect drink to keep me alive while I type out paragraphs after paragraphs of analysis on Chicano Studies.</p>

<p>Within the first two weeks, my friend (let’s call him Ryan) and I decided to go to ShengKee Bakery because Ryan was persistent on buying some Asian pasteries. So yes, we did not initially start going there for the milk tea but rather for pasteries that reminded us of home.</p>

<p>And while we were at it, we spied the menu which sold a <strong>chubby</strong> cup of milk tea for $2.99 – and toppings are free!! For two cheap, Asian, and college students, this was a <em>great</em> deal. As a result, Ryan and I picked our drinks. Tiger Milk Tea with boba for Ryan, and Jasmine Milk Tea with boba for me. I had the Jasmine Milk Tea specially made because at the time, they did not have it. Instead they had Jasmine Tea, and ended up mixing it with the regular half and half.</p>
