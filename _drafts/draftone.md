It was Maplestory that taught me how to be artistic through making Maplestory Music Videos (often called MMVs). As a child, I would spend endless hours editing video clips to make it pretty and stylish in order to get more YouTube viewers. Actually, I'd say I did a pretty good job -- at my peak, I had over 1000 subscribers. 

However, it was Gaiaonline that gave me a glimpse into coding. Long story short, it is a forum that allowed you to decorate your personal page using CSS. This forum has an economy (*a bad one post2010, I might add*), and there were a few ways to make it to the top. The top three ways are: spend real money, be very artistic sell your drawings, or be somewhat competent in design and code people's personal pages. I made most of my gold (Gaia's currency) through the third way. 

And from there, I became interested in design and programming.
