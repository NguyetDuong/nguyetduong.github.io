			<h2>You had me at "Hello World!"</h2>
			<p>Hello! This is my personal website for work, business, and fun stuff. </p><br>

			<p>If you are a <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">GWC</a> student, you came to the right place. For information on our course and helpful links, click on the GWC tab. If you need to email me, click on the contact me page. Otherwise, feel free to just browse around as you like. </p>  <br />

			<p>For others who have stumbled upon my page, I hope you enjoy your stay and learn more about me. </p>  <br />

			<h2>My reasons for having a page?</h2>
			<p>I had a competition with somebody to see who can create the better website. Sadly, I think it's a tie, even though I wanted to win so bad! Aside from this, I figured it would be a good idea to brush up on my html and css skills -- it has been a very long time since I have messed around with it. However I definitely stepped up from my old website I made when I was younger... I actually included some JQuery. Hopefully my website continues to grow! :)

			<p> <h1>Who is the Boba Queen?</h1>
				<b>Name:</b> Nguyet Duong
				<br />
				<b>Nickname:</b> Mimi
				<br />
				<b>Age:</b> 19
				<br />
				<b>School:</b> University of California, Berkeley
				<br />
				<b>Profession:</b> Full time boba drinker
			</p>
			<p>
				If you look on the left, you will see me. This picture is taken at Golden Gate Park, located in San Francisco. My friend took this lovely picture on our "photoshoot" day. Photography is something I do very casually and not often at all. If you are interested in the pictures my friend and I took on that day,  <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/130898578@N03/">click here!</a> Hopefully you don't look through all of the photos... some of them show a wilder side of me. 
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Speaking of wild sides, I love boba (if you have not noticed already)!! I spend a good amount of my time (and expenses) on these sugary drinks with tapioca balls inside of them. It is commonly known as boba drinks, tapioca drinks, and milk tea with boba/pearls. However, I have to admit that I don't get the boba/pearls/tapioca with my drink most of the time. But I enjoy the drink itself! I probably used to get at least one or two on a daily basis. Thankfully, I have stopped myself from consuming so much boba lately. 
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Aside from having a bit of a sugar addiction problem, I spend some of my free time on Summoner's Rift. For those of you who don't know, Summoner's Rift is a map/gamemode for <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com">League of Legends</a>. Competitively, I am currently ranked as Gold I. However, I wouldn't be surprised if I played like a lower ranked because I am not super serious about the game. I would say that I spend a lot more time playing casually with friends than playing for rank.
