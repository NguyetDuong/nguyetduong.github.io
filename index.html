			<h2>You had me at "Hello World!"</h2>
			<p>Hello! This is my personal website for work, business, and fun stuff. </p><br>

			<p>If you are a <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">GWC</a> student, you came to the right place. For information on our course and helpful links, click on the GWC tab. If you need to email me, click on the contact me page. Otherwise, feel free to just browse around as you like. </p>  <br />

			<p>For others who have stumbled upon my page, I hope you enjoy your stay and learn more about me. </p>  <br />

			<h2>My reasons for having a page?</h2>
			<p>I had a competition with somebody to see who can create the better website. Sadly, I think it's a tie, even though I wanted to win so bad! Aside from this, I figured it would be a good idea to brush up on my html and css skills -- it has been a very long time since I have messed around with it. However I definitely stepped up from my old website I made when I was younger... I actually included some JQuery. Hopefully my website continues to grow! :)

			<p> <h1>Who is the Boba Queen?</h1>
				<b>Name:</b> Nguyet Duong
				<br />
				<b>Nickname:</b> Mimi
				<br />
				<b>Age:</b> 19
				<br />
				<b>School:</b> University of California, Berkeley
				<br />
				<b>Profession:</b> Full time boba drinker

				If you look on the left, you will see me! But don't expect too much out of me when you see me in person. I normally don't look that good -- I swear it's all the photographer, lightroom, photoshop, and camera. But don't worry, it didn't go through such a massive edit to the point you won't be able to recognize me on the streets. I hope from this paragraph you can tell I have a weird sense of humor. Of course, you're probably still wondering who I am. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I was born in Vietnam and came to America when I was young. At the time, I spent most of my days playing with dolls and stuffed animals like many kids do. It wasn't until sometime in elementary school that we were forced to take a computer class. Honestly, I didn't think much of it at the time... it was more of playing the typing games that made me so happy. Let's just say I <i>rocked</i> those typing games. And it is also the reason why I type decently fast today.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Then come the age of video games online. I'm specifically talking about <a href="http://www.neopets.com/">Neopets</a>. Most of you probably know what it is. However, I specifically remember that in order to play Neopets, I needed to sign up. And in order to sign up, I needed an email address. But I was eight? nine? at the time, there's no way I could have known how to create an email address. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Luckily, the computer teacher said she can help me make one if I bring in a note with my parent's permission on it. And that was the start of my love for technology. It was all a domino affect and I ended up playing on multiple different websites, different games, and met many different people from all around the world. This chain of actions led me to where I am today and made me understand what I am passionate about.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Even now, I still have not fully let go of all of my childhood by still playing games at whatever moment I have. Nowadays, you can find on <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/">Summoner's Rift</a>. Only when I'm not in school though because trying to keep my rankings is a little bit hard to do when I'm stressed out over school work.... 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Wow, that was sort of cheesy. But aside from the computer and all of this jazz, I spend a lot of my time hanging out at boba (otherwise known as tapioca drink, milk tea) shops. If you are from California, it is a big hype right now. And I'm not even going to lie. I am addicted to this stuff. So if you run into me on the streets, there is a 95% chance that I will have some sort of boba cup on me.
