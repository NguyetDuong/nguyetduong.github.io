Hi! I'm Mimi (or Nguyet) and welcome to my personal website. 

For those of you viewed this website previous, you may notice some things have changed. This site is no longer a blog, as I decided to move my blog onto a wordpress platform instead. 

I will link y'all to the site when it is finished and up!

But for all of those who are new, here is a little blurb about me: I'm currently getting my undergraduate degree at the **University of California, Berkeley**. 

I am currently spending my summer at **Target Headquarters** as a **Software Engineer Intern** while working on my blog and YouTube channel -- so keep a heads up for that! 

Outside of academia, I spend a lot of my time playing [League of Legends](http://pvp.net). In fact, I spent over two years as a board on [League of Legends committee at UC Berkeley](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~legends/), and one and a half year as its president.

My focus in life right now is to find my own way in life. I hope to find or build a career path that I will be happy with five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty years from now. Don't worry, I'll keep you all updated! And don't be afraid to reach out and connect with me, I always enjoy meeting new people.
