**Happy New Years!**

Last year had really been more stressful than I could have ever imagined. I had a lot of ups and downs. I was lost more than a million times on what to do, and where to go. But I suppose that was because I was never really focused on what I am trying to get out of the year. 

I want to change that this year. I need a set of reminders on how I want this new year to be different from the last. This new year should be more of an improvement from the last because I am sick of how it's been, and I realized that nothing is ever going to change unless I fix it. 

So this is probably my first year in a long time that I have a new year's goals. I came up with some of these after talking with someone about what I had in mind for the new year. It made me realize that I never really had a guided direction into anything, and maybe having some goals will push me into the right direction this year?

________ 

So here we go...

**1. Keep up with my blog.**
I seriously created this website for a blog, and I have not written a single thing since September. I feel like I am just so caught up in my life with all of its technical aspects that I don't focus on my creativity side anymore. For all of those who don't know -- I used to blog *a lot* back in high school. So hopefully I can get at least a post a month or even maybe do a challenge to blog every day for 30 days straight! 

**2. Cut down on all that milk tea.** 
Let's be honest, it really is not that healthy to drink a cup a day. Maybe twice or three times a week would be more reasonable. It's becoming a really unhealthy habit in my life that I need to cut out. The sugar addiction really is not helping me with anything at this point.

**3. Keep a personal journal, and write in it everyday.**
I really enjoyed writing in the past, as I've mentioned before about my daily blog posts in high school. Unfortunately every year since the start of college, I made up excuses to not write in it because I was *too* busy. This semester will be my lightest semester, so I should be able to keep this goal, even if it's only 200 words a day. 

**4. Be more social!**
What I've noticed over the past few years in college is that I have became less and less social. As in I no longer go out of my way to talk to strangers anymore because I've became a lot more shy.

This seems a lot for my goals this year, and I don't expect myself to accomplish every single one gracefully. However I hope that by December 31, 2016, I can say that I have accomplished at least one of these goals. Wish me luck, and let me know what goal(s) you have for the new year!
