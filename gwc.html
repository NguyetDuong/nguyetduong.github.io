			<p>Above is an image of a group of wonderful teachers and TAs who I went through training with! Picture is taken by Miss Esther Fensel on Mister Esteban Rojas's camera. You can see Esteban in the third row from the front, all the way to the right. </p> <br />

			<h3>Open House Message</h3>
			<p>Hi, I'm Nguyet -- one of the TAs for this summer. Unfortunately, I am not able to attend the open house because I have a very nasty bug in my system and I want to get over it as soon as possible so that I can give my all on Monday. Plus, I don't think any of you (students, parents, and coworkers) want to catch my bug. </p> <br />
			<p>A little bit about me is that I am an incoming third year at UC Berkeley. My name is a little bit hard to pronounce so feel free to call me Mimi! Choose whichever one you feel most comfortable calling me by. I'm super excited to get to know everyone and help y'all see why I love computers (or technology in general) the way I do. I swear, I'm practically glued to my laptop and phone. 
			</p> <br />
			<p>If my hands aren't on my phone or laptop, you'll probably find me attached to my boba cup. I am seriously addicted to that stuff -- it is sort of like my coffee. Hopefully by the end of summer, I can have all of us do a boba run, like I did with many of the teachers who were at the same training as I was! </p> <br />

			<h2>Office Hours</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				So what are office hours? If you don't know, they are times allocated outside of the classroom environment for you to ask me any questions related to the class. This can be for extra help on certain topics/materials or questions about computer science in general. 
			</p> 
			<br />
			<p>
				My office hours are <b>Tuesdays</b> and <b>Thursdays</b> at 8pm to 9pm. It will all be online. When you are ready or have a question, <a href="https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/girlswhocode.com/office-hours?authuser=0">join the call</a>.
